                Hi, my name is Ian and I live in Maryland. I am the youngest sibling in my family with two sisters.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                
                I attend CCBC Essex and my major here is General Studies. This is my major because they do not have a major in information systems. 
             I plan to take classes here for two years that will transfer to Towson University where I will major in information systems.

            <h2>Skills/Hobbies</h2>
            <p>

                My hobbies mainly consist of playing soccer and playing videogames. I have played soccer competitively for my entire life.
             However now that I am in college I decided to stop playing competitively to focus on school.
