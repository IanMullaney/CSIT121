    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

    <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
    <p>Through completing this final project, along with all of the other labs and quizzes in this course, I feel like I have 
        grown a lot and have learned so much. There have been so many times during the course that I felt really challenged and 
        did not know if I would be able to complete certain things. But then from not giving up and going back to the course materials
        and going through trial and error, I surprised myself multiple times with what I accomplished. I think that is one thing that
        made this course so enjoyable, that really nice feeling you get when you complete something that you've been working on for 
        what seems like forever. This mindset has also carried over into other courses that I'm taking and has allowed me to
        push myself and to believe in myself when I'm having a lot of trouble.
    </p>

    <h3>Final Project Reflection</h3>
    <p>This project was as expected, the hardest thing to do all semester. There are so many different parts to this 
      project that I had trouble with. I had a hard time deciding how to layout all the information, what I wanted my 4 different main pages 
      to be about, how to put the two pictures where I wanted them, and how to showcase my past labs. This was also especially tough because of how I have been 
      slacking off the past few weeks. DEspite all of this, I worked on this project for so long, to the point where I will be submitting this 
      so close to the submission deadline that I am a little stressed. However, even with all that, I would still say that I had so much fun 
      completing this project. It was super rewarding once I finished and put together everything that I learned throughout the course. 
    </p>

    <h3>Course Reflection</h3>
    <p>Throughout this course, I gained solid foundations in HTML and CSS. I also learned the value of accessibility, semantic structure, and responsive design, all of which I tried my best 
        to apply in this final portfolio. I personally loved this course because of how the modules and the work was spread out. The weekly modules where we learned
        one or two big topics and then had the whole week to learn about it and apply it to our web pages were great for me because I was not super 
        overwhelmed with work, but I was also never bored with nothing new to learn or to work on.
