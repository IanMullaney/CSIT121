                <p class="lab-overview">This is the first web page that I am officially making from scratch. It is a lot to
                    remember with so many different tags and structures.</p>
                <h3>Things I Learned:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>How to use VS code to create my web pages</li>
                    <li>A variety of different tags to use when creating my web page to properly format</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I also learned how to insert hyperlinks to my page. Below are 2 links to sites I use when 
                    creating my web pages.</p>

                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Here is a site that helps me learn HTML</a></li>

                <h2>Lab 03</h2>
                <p class="lab-overview">This is my lab number 3 where I am incorporating CSS into my web page to make it look better!</p>
                <h3>Things I learned during Module 3:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>How to link an external CSS file into my HTML file</li>
                    <li>How to customize different elements to different things</li>
                    <li>What different selectors there are and how to use them all</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I learned a lot of things in this module that will definitely help me in the future.
                    I like how there are so many ways to customize everything in the document to truly 
                    make it look however you want. There are so many properties that I still haven't used
                    and I'm looking forward to expanding my knowledge!</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>I really liked doing this lab because it made my web page look so much better.
                    I added links to each lab section and also wrapped the articles in a div container 
                    for better layout control. In the CSS file I used CSS Grid for the layout, and 
                    applied media queries to switch between single-column and multi-column based
                    on the width of the user's screen.
