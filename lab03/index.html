        <h2>Labs 01 and 02</h2>
        <p class="lab-overview">This is the first web page that i am officially making from scratch. It is a lot to
            remember with so many different tags and structures.
        </p>

        <h2>Lab 03</h2>
        <p class="lab-overview">This is my lab number 3 where I am incorporating css into my web page to make it look better!</p>
        <h3>Things I learned during Module 3:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>How to link an external css file into my html file</li>
            <li>How to customize different elements to different things</li>
            <li>What different selectors there are and how to use them all</li>
        </ol>

        <p> I learned a lot of things in this module that will definitely help me in the future.
            I like how there are so many ways to customize everything in the document to truly 
            make it look however you want. There are so many properties that I still haven't used
            and i'm looking forward to expand my knowledge!
