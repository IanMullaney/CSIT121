        <h1>Lab04: Image Showcase</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my lab #04 where I show how to add images to my web pages</p>
        <p>Below is a list of 3 different images of different types including GIF, JPEG, and PNG </p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><a href="gif.html">GIF Image Example</a></li>
            <li><a href="jpeg.html">JPEG Image Example</a></li>
            <li><a href="png.html">PNG Image Example</a></li>
     </ul>
     <p>In this lab I tried making 2 different stylesheets, one for the index, and one for all the other html files to create some contrast. 
        I also just looked at the rubric for this lab and saw that I was supposed to use only 1 css sheet. I did a lot of extra work to make 
        2 css sheets so I'm going to just submit what I've made.
